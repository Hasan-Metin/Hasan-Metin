### Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parth-27/parth-27/master/Hi.gif" width="30px">
-I work in Senior / Lead Front-End roles within the React ecosystem. I take responsibility not only for feature development, but also for defining front-end architecture, providing technical direction, and increasing overall team productivity in web applications.

-I have designed component architectures, state management approaches, and shared UI layers for large-scale React-based applications. I played an active role in the development of UI frameworks, render engines, and Low-Code / No-Code platforms, defining their architecture and building foundations that enable multiple teams to deliver consistent and scalable products. I have strong experience building long-term, maintainable systems using TypeScript.

-In my development workflow, I integrate AI agents as tools for code generation, refactoring, evaluating architectural alternatives, and supporting technical decision-making. My focus is not individual productivity alone, but establishing standardized, team-level AI-assisted development practices.

-I take ownership of front-end technical decision-making, coding standards, and architectural consistency. Through mentoring, I aim to increase the technical maturity of teams while keeping technical debt under control.

-My focus is on building front-end teams that do not merely deliver features, but actively own and grow the technical foundation of the product. I concentrate on reusable infrastructures and tooling that improve developer experience and support sustainable front-end architectures at scale.
